      "The terrible thing about a consensus system like Bitcoin is that every on-chain action we perform affects every other user of the system. That makes all of us neighbors, so we're faced with the choice of either being the bad neighbors who complain endlessly about each other or the good neighbors who work together to solve problems and find ways to coexist in harmony."
