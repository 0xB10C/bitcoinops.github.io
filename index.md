The Bitcoin Operations Technology Group (OpTech) works to bring the best
open source technologies and techniques to Bitcoin-using businesses in
order to lower costs and improve customer experiences.  An initial focus
for the group is working with its member organizations to reduce
transaction sizes and minimize the effect of subsequent transaction fee
increases.

Long-term goals include providing documentation, a weekly newsletter,
original research, remote and on-site training, on-demand consultation,
and facilitating improved relations between businesses and open source
developers.
