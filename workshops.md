Bitcoin Optech will run a series of workshops to bring Bitcoin engineers
together to discuss approaches and challenges in implementing scaling
technologies. Each workshop will be tailored to the member companies attending
and the specific scaling challenges that they are facing.

- Topics are discussed in a roundtable format in which every participant has an
  equal opportunity to engage.

- Each topic has a moderator and notetaker. The moderator is responsible
  for a brief introduction of a topic and keeping discussion on track and on
  time.

- We want participants to be comfortable to speak freely. Notes and action
  items are distributed to participants but not beyond. Participants are
  free to share discussion details internally at their companies and publicly,
  but should refrain from attributing any particular statement to a given
  individual (Chatham House Rules).

## Workshop #2 - Paris, Fall 2018

We are in the early stages of planning the second Bitcoin Optech workshop in
Paris for Fall 2018. Member companies who would like to attend should

## Workshop #1 - San Francisco, July 17 2018

Bitcoin Optech held our first workshop at Square in San Francisco on July
17 2018. In attendence were 14 engineers from SF Bay Area Bitcoin companies.
